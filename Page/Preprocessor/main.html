        The <b>preprocessing</b> phase <b>precedes</b> the <b>compilation</b> of the source code.<br>
        It parses out <a href="#line-continuation-token">line continuation tokens</a> and <a href="#comments">comments</a> and executes preprocessor directives.
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>Preprocessor directives</b> are special instructions that allow the <b>code</b> of a module to be <b>programmatically modified</b>.<br>
        All the preprocessor directives are identified by the <code>#</code> character followed by their name and definition.<br>
        The name of preprocessor directives is always case sensitive.

    <p>
        Preprocessor operations are performed in the following order:<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;1. Line stitching: <a href="#line-continuation-token">Line continuation tokens</a> are removed.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;2. Literals: String and character literals are parsed, and escape sequences within them are replaced with their UTF-8 representation.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;3. Comment Removal: <a href="#comments">Comments</a> are removed from the code.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;4. File stitching: <a href="include-statement">Include statements</a> are processed recursively, merging all referenced files into one.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;5. Macro Definitions: <a href="#preprocessor-macro">Macro</a> definitions are evaluated and then removed from the code.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;6. Macro Calls: <a href="#preprocessor-macro">Macro</a> calls are replaced with their corresponding definitions, substituting each parameter with the provided argument, recursively.
