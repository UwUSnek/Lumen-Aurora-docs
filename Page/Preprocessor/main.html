    <p>
        The <b>preprocessing</b> phase <b>precedes</b> the code <b>compilation</b>.<br>
        It parses out <a href="#line-continuation-token">Line continuation tokens</a> and <a href="#comments">Comments</a> and processes preprocessor directives.
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>Preprocessor directives</b> are special instructions that allow the <b>code</b> to be <b>programmatically modified</b>.<br>
        All the preprocessor directives are identified by the <code>#</code> character followed by their name and definition.<br>
        Each directive spans over a single line of code.<br>
        Preprocessor directives are always case sensitive.
