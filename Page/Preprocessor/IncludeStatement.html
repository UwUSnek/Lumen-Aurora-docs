        NOTICE:<br>
        The language provides include statements, but they should be avoided whenever possible.<br>
        The <a href="#import-directive">import directive</a> does a much better job at importing other modules, looks cleaner and can be debugged easily.<br>
        Include statements should only be used if you know what you are doing and you are certain that import directives won't be enough.
    </ce-full-size->
    <p>
        The <b>include statement</b> is used to <b>paste code</b> from other files.<br>
        Any existing file with read permissions can be included, regardless of its contents or extension.<br>
        The path of the included file must be enclosed in <code>"</code> <code>"</code> characters.<br>
        <a href="#standard-modules">standard modules</a> are included using the <code>&lt;</code> <code>&gt;</code> characters.<br>
        The <a href="#core-module">core module</a> cannot be included.

    <p>
        Absolute and relative paths are both supported.<br>
        Relative paths are relative to the file the include statement is used in or any one of the specified include paths.<br> //TODO link. command line options
        <code>~</code> is not recognized as the home directory but as the literal character <code>~</code>.<br>
        <code>/</code> identifies the root directory.<br>
        <code>.</code> identifies the current directory, while <code>..</code> identifies the parent directory.
    </p>
    <p>
        The preprocessor supports Glob pattern wildcards:<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;<code>**</code> - Any sequence of characters including <code>/</code> (any length, including 0).<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;<code>*</code> - Any sequence of characters but <code>/</code> (any length, including 0).<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;<code>?</code> - Any character but <code>/</code>.<br>
        Glob patterns that don't match any file are allowed and have no effect.
    </p>
    <p>
        Files cannot be named <code>.</code> or <code>..</code>
        and their name cannot contain any of the these characters: <code>*?"&lt;&gt;\</code>.<br>
        Any other character is allowed.

    <p>
        Include statements can be used to create other preprocessor directives, but not other include statements. This is by design.<br>
        Include operations are performed by replacing the include statement in the destination file
        (from the <code>#</code> character to the closing <code>"</code> or <code>&gt;</code>) with the contents of the source file.<br>
        Every byte of the source file is copied without trimming or modifying any of it.
    </p>
    <p>
        In the case of glob patterns, all the source files are copied in the same way, one after the other, without adding any separator between them.<br>
        The order in which they are copied reflects their absolute file path:<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;Each directory level is ordered alphabetically, starting from the root directory.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;If two or more matches are in the same directory, they are ordered based on the next level. This goes on until all the files are ordered.<br>
        If the glob pattern has no matches, the include statement is simply removed.
    </p>
    <p>
        The last variable-length wildcard (<code>*</code> or <code>**</code>) of a glob pattern stops before the last occurrence of the character or wildcard that follows them.<br>
        Variable-length wildcards that are not last, instead, stop before the very first occurrence of the character or wildcard that follows them.<br>
        They are evaluated from left to right.<br>
    </p>
    <p>
        Symlinks in the included path are always resolved.
    </p>

        <div style="border-top-left-radius: var(--code-decoration-r);">
            <k->#include</k-> <s->"./*.*"</s-> <c->/*   This Glob pattern will match all of these:</c->
            <c->            │ │       ./file.txt        ./.txt        ./file.        ./file.txt.tmp.zip</c->
