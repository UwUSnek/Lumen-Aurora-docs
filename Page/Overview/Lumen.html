    <p>
        Lumen is a general-purpose high-level language with a C++-like syntax.<br>
        Its purpose is to provide the speed and power of low-level languages, without sacrificing readability and maintainability.<br>
        The language achieves this by offering features such as modules, reflection, a powerful optimizer and native support for both Windows and Linux.
    </p>
    <p>
        Lumen's optimizer focuses entirely on maximizing performance.<br>
        Before any optimization happens, the code is thoroughly parsed and simplified, so the optimizer can work without compromises.<br>
        This ensures that the performance is on par with C, while keeping the program's behaviour exactly as intended.<br>
        Advanced features like templates and reflection come with no performance penalty, letting developers focus on writing clean, effective code.
    </p>
    <p>
        Another key feature is its ability to improve the debugging experience.<br>
        Lumen includes built-in checks for common issues like overflows and race conditions, and allows developers to add custom ones.<br>
        They are easily toggleable and are meant to be used during development.<br>
        This ensures that developers can catch problems before they escalate, making the code more robust without affecting performance when deploying the final product.
    </p>
    <p>
        Unlike most modern languages, Lumen is not Object-Oriented.<br>
        Instead, features usually associated with OOP are implemented using templates and reflection.<br>
        These provide better runtime performance while maintaining flexibility.
