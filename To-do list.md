# To do

- replace all outputs of examples with outputs generated using the compiler
  - generate the colors too, using the same system the vsc extension uses

- benchmark the compiled code and compare it to other languages
  - show benchmark results in the documentation
  - also show how the code gets optimized & benchmark both the optimized version and unoptimized one (--o-none)
