# To do

- replace all outputs of examples with outputs generated using the compiler
  - generate the colors too, using the same system the vsc extension uses

- benchmark the compiled code and compare it to other languages
  - show benchmark results in the documentation
  - also show how the code gets optimized & benchmark both the optimized version and unoptimized one (--o-none)

- add a "since version x.y.z" to each feature or something like that

- remove " and ' from keywords. they aren't keywords, they are literal definitions that use reserved tokens

- remove "limits" standard module. This stuff should be part of the primitive types' reflection data
- remove "types" too, no idea what it was meant for but its probably useless

- Improve page sliding animation
